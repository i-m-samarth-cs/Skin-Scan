    ## What is SkinScan?
    
    **SkinScan** is an innovative, AI-powered application designed to assist healthcare professionals in the early detection 
    and classification of skin lesions that may indicate skin cancer. Leveraging cutting-edge deep learning technology, 
    SkinScan analyzes skin lesion images and provides real-time predictions, aiding in faster and more accurate diagnosis.
    
    **Important Disclaimer:** SkinScan is a supplementary tool and is not a replacement for professional medical judgment. 
    The predictions provided by the app must always be verified by qualified healthcare providers.

        ### Melanoma
        The most dangerous type of skin cancer, melanoma develops in melanocytes (cells that produce pigment). 
        Early detection is critical for successful treatment.
        
        **Warning Signs (ABCDE rule):**

        - Pearly bump or flat scar-like lesion
        - Bleeding or scabbing sores

        **Warning Signs:**
        - Firm red nodule
        - Crusty, scaly lesion

    ## Risk Factors
    
    Several factors can increase the likelihood of developing skin cancer:
    - **UV Exposure:** Excessive sun exposure or tanning beds
    - **Fair Skin:** Less protection from UV radiation
    - **History of Sunburns:** Especially early in life
    - **Family History:** Genetic predisposition
    - **Age:** Risk increases with age
    - **Unusual Moles:** Some moles can indicate higher risk
    - **Weak Immune System:** Due to disease or medications

    # Prevention Tips Section
    st.markdown("""
    ## Prevention Tips
    
    Preventing skin cancer involves simple but effective strategies:
    - **Sun Protection:** Use broad-spectrum sunscreen (SPF 30+)
    - **Avoid Peak Sun Hours:** Minimize exposure between 10 AM and 4 PM
    - **Wear Protective Clothing:** Hats, sunglasses, long sleeves
    - **Skip Tanning Beds:** Avoid artificial UV exposure
    - **Regular Checks:** Perform monthly self-examinations and annual dermatologist visits

    # Technology Behind SkinScan Section
    st.markdown("""
    ## Technology Behind SkinScan
    
    SkinScan uses a **deep convolutional neural network (CNN)** trained on thousands of dermatological images. 
    The model processes the images, learns from each new analysis, and provides predictions with a high level of accuracy.
    
    **How it Works:**
    1. **Image Upload:** Healthcare professionals upload skin lesion images
    2. **Image Preprocessing:** The app standardizes images for analysis
    3. **AI Analysis:** Our CNN model processes the image and predicts potential skin cancer types
    4. **Results Displayed:** Predictions with confidence levels and recommendations are shown
    5. **Follow-up:** Results can be saved to patient records
